# 📦 Lean Six Sigma Project: Data-Driven Quality Improvement in Beverage Manufacturing

This repository showcases a APS 4742 group project applying **Lean Six Sigma methodology** to a real-world-inspired scenario involving defect reduction and process optimization in a **non-carbonated beverage production line**.

---

## 🎯 Project Objective

To analyze and reduce the rate of underfilled bottles in the **Energy Drink** and **Protein Shake** product lines by identifying root causes, minimizing variation, and applying quality improvement tools such as **DMAIC**, **Control Charts**, **Fishbone Diagrams**, and **ANOVA analysis**.

---

## 🏭 Problem Context

- Company: FMCG sector, beverage manufacturing  
- Products: Aloe Juice, Energy Drink, Protein Shake  
- Bottles must meet a net weight of **500g ± 5g**  
- Key problems observed:
  - **Underfilled bottles (<495g)**
  - **High defect rates** during **evening shifts**
  - **Machine PX2 variability**
  - **Operator inconsistencies**

---

## 🧰 Methodology: DMAIC Approach

### 1. **Define**
- Clear identification of production quality issues
- Focused on Energy Drink and Protein Shake lines

### 2. **Measure**
- Collected weight data from multiple shifts, machines, and operators
- Performed **Descriptive Statistics** and **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

### 3. **Analyze**
- Applied:
  - **Control Charts**
  - **Fishbone (Ishikawa) Diagrams**
  - **ANOVA** and **Correlation Analysis**
- Identified PX2 machine and evening shift as major contributors to defects

### 4. **Improve**
- Proposed:
  - Hourly machine checks
  - Standard operating procedures (SOPs) for cleaning and pressure regulation
  - Retraining of operators using visual guides
  - Feedback loop integration via sensors

### 5. **Control**
- Monitoring system to track defect trends
- Standardization of corrective procedures

## 📊 Tools & Technologies

- **RStudio** for EDA and statistical analysis  
- **Microsoft Excel** for control charts and data preprocessing  
- **PowerPoint** for final presentation  

---

## 📈 Key Results

- **Defect Rate:** 1.3% (DPMO ≈ 13,000)  
- **PX2 Machine** responsible for **37.9%** of underfilled bottles  
- **Evening Shift** contributed **62.1%** of total defects  
- **Root Causes Identified:** Poor machine calibration, inconsistent operating procedures, and lack of operator training
